abstract = {Smart home products aren’t living up to their promise. They claim to transform the way we live, providing convenience, energy efficiency, and safety. However, the reality is significantly less profound and often frustrating. This is particularly apparent in security and privacy experiences: powerlessness, confusion, and annoyance have all been reported. In order to reduce frustration and help fulfill the promise of smart homes, we need to explore the experience of security and privacy in situ. We analyze an ethnographic study observing six UK households over six months to present a longitudinal view of security and privacy user experiences in smart products. We find inconsistencies in managing security and privacy, e.g., contrasting the ease of granting and difficulty of withholding consent. We identify security and privacy issues in repurposing smart home devices – using devices outside of their initial intended purposes. We conclude with recommendations for design in smart home devices.},

  abstract = {A smart home is a term for homes with smart
devices that implements the internet of things concept. These
devices are connected to the internet network and can be
controlled remotely using an application. The advantages of
smart homes include increasing efficiency for daily tasks and
improving house safety. However, it is important to know that
there are several security concerns in implementing the internet
of things in smart homes. This research mainly aims to identify
all the important security factors in smart homes and how
to enhance them. A systematic literature review method was
used for data collection to achieve this goal. As a result, a
considerable number of cyber attacks identified in this paper
and vulnerabilities found in internet of things devices themselves
in smart homes. Lastly, this research recommends a solution to
enhance security in smart homes. These findings are beneficial to
increasing the security awareness of internet of things users and
removing doubts about building smart homes with the internet
of things.},

abstract = {One of the biggest privacy concerns of smart home users is enforcing limits on household members&#x27; access to devices and each other&#x27;s data. While people commonly express preferences for intricate access control policies, in practice they often settle for less secure defaults. As an alternative, this paper investigates &quot;optimistic access control&quot; policies that allow users to obtain access and data without pre-approval, subject to oversight from other household members. This solution allows users to leverage the interpersonal trust they already rely on in order to establish privacy boundaries commensurate with more complex access control methods, while retaining the convenience of less secure strategies. To evaluate this concept, we conducted a series of surveys with 604 people total, studying the acceptability and perceptions of this approach. We found that a number of respondents preferred optimistic modes to existing access control methods and that interest in optimistic access varied with device type and household characteristics.},

abstract = {Intelligent personal assistants (IPA), such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, are becoming increasingly present in multi-user households leading to questions about privacy and consent, particularly for those who do not directly own the device they interact with. When these devices are placed in shared spaces, every visitor and cohabitant becomes an indirect user, potentially leading to discomfort, misuse of services, or unintentional sharing of personal data. To better understand how owners and visitors perceive IPAs, we interviewed 10 in-house users (account owners and cohabitants) and 9 visitors from a student and young professionals sample who have interacted with such devices on various occasions. We find that cohabitants in shared households with regular IPA interactions see themselves as owners of the device, although not having the same controls as the account owner. Further, we determine the existence of a smart speaker etiquette which doubles as trust-based boundary management. Both in-house users and visitors demonstrate similar attitudes and concerns around data use, constant monitoring by the device, and the lack of transparency around device operations. We discuss interviewees' system understanding, concerns, and protection strategies and make recommendation to avoid tensions around shared devices.},

abstract = {Home is a person's castle, a private and protected space. Internet-connected devices such as locks, cameras, and speakers might make a home "smarter" but also raise privacy issues because these devices may constantly and inconspicuously collect, infer or even share information about people in the home. To explore user-centered privacy designs for smart homes, we conducted a co-design study in which we worked closely with diverse groups of participants in creating new designs. This study helps fill the gap in the literature between studying users' privacy concerns and designing privacy tools only by experts. Our participants' privacy designs often relied on simple strategies, such as data localization, disconnection from the Internet, and a private mode. From these designs, we identified six key design factors: data transparency and control, security, safety, usability and user experience, system intelligence, and system modality. We discuss how these factors can guide design for smart home privacy.},

abstract = {Smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices are rapidly increasing in popularity, with more households including Internet-connected devices that continuously monitor user activities. In this study, we conduct eleven semi-structured interviews with smart home owners, investigating their reasons for purchasing IoT devices, perceptions of smart home privacy risks, and actions taken to protect their privacy from those external to the home who create, manage, track, or regulate IoT devices and/or their data. We note several recurring themes. First, users' desires for convenience and connectedness dictate their privacy-related behaviors for dealing with external entities, such as device manufacturers, Internet Service Providers, governments, and advertisers. Second, user opinions about external entities collecting smart home data depend on perceived benefit from these entities. Third, users trust IoT device manufacturers to protect their privacy but do not verify that these protections are in place. Fourth, users are unaware of privacy risks from inference algorithms operating on data from non-audio/visual devices. These findings motivate several recommendations for device designers, researchers, and industry standards to better match device privacy features to the expectations and preferences of smart home owners.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly present in many family homes, yet it is unclear precisely how well families understand the cyber security threats and risks of using such devices, and how possible it is for them to educate themselves on these topics. Using a survey of 553 parents and interviews with 25 families in the UK, we find that families do not consider home IoT devices to be significantly different in terms of threats than more traditional home computers, and believe the major risks to be largely mitigated through consumer protection regulation. As a result, parents focus on teaching being careful with devices to prolong device life use, exposing their families to additional security risks and modeling incorrect security behaviors to their children. This is a risk for the present and also one for the future, as children are not taught about the IoT, and appropriate cyber security management of such devices, at school. We go on to suggest that steps must be taken by manufacturers and governments or appropriate trusted institutions to improve the cyber security knowledge and behaviors of both adults and children in relation to the use of home IoT devices.},

devices in spaces shared with guests, we seek to understand the security and privacy implications of these devices for both hosts and guests. We conducted a largescale survey of 82 hosts and 554 guests to explore their
current technology practices, their preferences for smart
devices and data collection/sharing, and their privacy
and security concerns in the context of Airbnbs. We
found that guests preferred smart devices, even viewed
them as a luxury, but some guests were concerned
that smart devices enable excessive monitoring and control, which could lead to repercussions from hosts (e.g.,
locked thermostat). On average, the views of guests and
hosts on data collection in Airbnb were aligned, but for
the data types where differences occur, serious privacy
violations might happen. For example, 90% of our guest
participants did not want to share their Internet history
with hosts, but one in five hosts wanted access to that
information. Overall, our findings surface tensions between hosts and guests around the use of smart devices
and in-home data collection. We synthesize recommendations to address the surfaced tensions and identify
broader research challenges.},

We interviewed 21 non-owner participants in the lab and 18 owners of these devices over the phone. While both novice users and existing owners were primarily driven by desired functionality while setting up their devices, their configuration decisions impact what data gets collected and how that data and the device are used and shared.
